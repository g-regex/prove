# Indentation rules:
# - If a statement (i.e. a chain like [..][..][..]) is preceded or followed
#   by "=>", then insert a line break before the statement.
# - If a "[" precedes an implication formula, increase the indentation level
#   from the next line onwards (i.e. by adding a tabstop, which is equivalent to
#   8 spaces).
# - If a "]" follows an implication formula, insert a line break before the "]"
#   and decrease the indentation level from the line containing the "]"
#   onwards.
#
# Spacing:
# - Before every "=>" insert a space.
# - Between every single statement, which is part of an implication formula or 
#   a statement (i.e. a chain like [..][..][..]), insert a space.
#
# Line Width:
# - If a single statement, which is part of an implication formula would cause
#   the maximum line width of 80 characters to be exceeded, a new line is to be
#   inserted before that single statement, if the exceedence of the line width
#   can be avoided by doing so. In the next line the indentation level is to be
#   maintained.
