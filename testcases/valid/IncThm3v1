##3. Prove that for any two distinct points P and Q lying on a line a, and for any point R not lying on a, there does not exist a line which passes through the points P, Q and R.

##Theorem formulation

##Theorem proof

[p][[p]:point]
[q][[q]:point]
[ [[p]=[q]]=> [[]False] ]

[a][[a]:line]
[[p]in[a]]
[[q]in[a]]

[r][[r]:point]
[ [[r]in[a]]=> [[]False] ]
=>

##assume such a line exists. By Axiom 3 formulation 2, the line must equal a, and so r cannot be in it. The existence of a line through all three points therefore implies false
