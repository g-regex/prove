Prove that for any given line lying on
a plane, there exists a point lying on the same
plane which does not lie on the given line.

##the theorem, formulated
[l1][[l1]:line][pln][[pln]:plane]=>
[ [[l1]in[pln]]=>[p1][[p1]:point][[p1]in[pln]][[[p1]in[l1]]=>[[]False] ]


##proof starts here
[y][[y]:line] [x][[x]:plane]=>


[ [[y]in[x]]=> 

##there exist these components in a plane, from Axiom 2b
[

[p1][[p1]:point]
[p2][[p2]:point]
[p3][[p3]:point]

[ [[p1]=[p2]]=> [[]False] ]
[ [[p1]=[p3]]=> [[]False] ]
[ [[p2]=[p3]]=> [[]False] ]

##how to assign names to specific instantiations of these points, whilst keeping the previous properties?
[ [pt1]=[p1] ]=>
[ [pt2]=[p2] ]=>
[ [pt3]=[p3] ]=>

##allowed by Axiom 2 b
[[pt2]in[y]]=>
[[pt3]in[y]]=>


##the assumption which contradicts that no line exists through all three of these specific points
[[pt1]in[y]]=>
[
=>[y][[y]:line]
[[p1]in[[y]]
[[p2]in[[y]]
[[p3]in[[y]]
]=>
[[]False]=>

[ [[pt1]in[y]]=>[[]False] ]=>

##consolidating the desirable facts scattered throughout the proof
[p][[p]:point]

[not[[p]in[y]] ]=>

##desired conclusion
[ [[y]in[x]]=>[pt1][[pt1]:point][[pt1]in[x]][not[[pt1]in[y]] ]
